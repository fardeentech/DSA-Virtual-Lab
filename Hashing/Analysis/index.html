              <h1>Running Time of Hashing</h1>
              <p>
                Hashing is an efficient way to map data (keys) to specific locations (hash codes) in a hash table. The efficiency of this operation depends on how well the hash function distributes keys and how collisions are handled.
              </p>
              <p>
                The time complexity of inserting, deleting, or searching for an element in a hash table is <strong>O(1)</strong> on average, meaning the operation can be performed in constant time. However, in the worst-case scenario, where multiple collisions occur and all keys are mapped to the same bucket, the time complexity can degrade to <strong>O(N)</strong>, where <strong>N</strong> is the number of elements.
              </p>

                <h1>Best and Worst Cases for Hashing</h1>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> The hash function distributes keys evenly across the hash table, minimizing collisions. In this case, each element is placed directly into its unique bucket, resulting in constant-time operations. The best-case time complexity is <strong>O(1)</strong>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> All keys hash to the same index in the hash table, causing a large number of collisions. If collisions are resolved using chaining, the worst-case time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations is <strong>O(N)</strong>, where <strong>N</strong> is the total number of elements.</li>

                <h1>Space Complexity of Hashing</h1>
                <p>
                  The space complexity of a hash table depends on the number of elements and the size of the hash table itself. In general, if <strong>N</strong> elements are stored, and the table has <strong>M</strong> slots, the space complexity is <strong>O(N + M)</strong>. Typically, hash tables are designed with enough space (M) to minimize collisions, which helps achieve constant-time performance.

                <h1>Handling Collisions in Hashing</h1>
                <p>
                  Hashing often faces the issue of <strong>collisions</strong>, which occur when two different keys hash to the same index. There are various techniques to handle collisions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Chaining:</strong> Multiple elements are stored in a list at the same index. When a collision occurs, the new element is added to the list at the corresponding bucket.</li>
                  <li><strong>Open Addressing:</strong> When a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available index based on a probing sequence (linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Both methods aim to maintain efficient data retrieval, although chaining is often more robust in practice when collisions are frequent.
                </p>

                <h1>Stability in Hashing</h1>
                <p>
                  Unlike some sorting algorithms, <strong>Hashing is not inherently stable</strong>. Stability is typically not a concern in hashing because the primary goal is efficient data retrieval, and hashing does not involve ordering of elements in the same way as sorting algorithms do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, stability can be implemented in certain hashing schemes by storing additional information about the original order of elements within the hash table, but this increases complexity.
